    We are importing the numpy library which we will use for mathematical operations

    We are defining a class LinearRegression which will contain our linear regression model.

    In the __init__ method, we are initializing the weights attribute as None. This attribute will store the coefficients of the linear regression model.

    The fit method takes in the training data as input, which is represented by the variables X and y.

    We are adding a column of ones to the input feature matrix X using numpy's insert function. This is to add the bias term to the linear regression model.

    We are then using the closed-form solution to calculate the weights of the linear regression model:
    self.weights = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y

    where X.T is the transpose of X, X.T @ X is the dot product of X.T and X and np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) is the inverse of this dot prod    We are importing the numpy library which we will use for mathematical operations

    The predict method takes in the test data as input and makes predictions using the weights that we calculated in the previous step.

    We are adding a column of ones to the input feature matrix X using numpy's insert function. This is to add the bias term to the linear regression model.

    Finally, we are returning the dot product of input feature matrix X and the calculated weights, which gives us the predictions for the test data.

The math behind this code is based on the linear regression equation:
y = mx + c

where y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the line, x is the independent variable, and c is the y-intercept. In this equation, m and c are the coefficients of the linear regression model. In the code, we are finding the values of these coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of y.

In the closed-form solution that we are using in the code, we are using the following equation to calculate the coefficients:
(XTX)^-1XT\*y

where X is the input feature matrix, y is the output variable, and XT is the transpose of X. This equation gives us the values of the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of y.uct.
